Spotify Project using Terraform

-Create one folder in Local system
-Name SpotifyTerraformProject
-Open in VS code
-Now create provide file -provider.tf under project folder
-Search on google terraform providers -open terraform site and in search bar
-search spotify provider you will get providers names -choose spotify by:conradludgate
-on right side click on use provide -copy code and paste in provider.tf file
eg.
 terraform {
  required_providers {
    spotify = {
      source = "conradludgate/spotify"
      version = "0.2.7"
    }
  }
}

provider "spotify" {
  # Configuration options
}

#Under configuration options section you need to add api key to connect spotify account.

-So after configuration options add below code
api_key ="spot"   ("Spot" because we do not have key right now so create account on spotify developer)
-use link https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
-Create spotify account and login here and go to dashboard

-Click on create app
-Name My Playlist using terraform
-Description -Create multiple spotify playlist using terraform
-Redirect URL -http://localhost:27228/spotify_callback
-Tick I understand and save
-Click on setting 
(You will get client id and client secret to connect terraform to spotify and get api key )

-Now we need to create environment for client id and secret 
-go to vs code create file .env and paste below code and also paste your client id and secret between them.

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>

Save (ctrl s )
 
-Now we need to run spotify auth proxy as docker container 
(which will help to connect terraform and spotify) 
for that open docker desktop in background and run below command in terminal of VS code.

docker run --rm -it -p 27228:27228 --env-file .env ghcr.io/conradludgate/spotify-auth-proxy
(Here we are creating docker container which have docker image name - ghcr.io/conradludgate/spotify-auth-proxy:latest
in docker you will see image and container created )

-After successful running you will get APIKey and Auth URL. 
-Copy auth link open in new tab and click on agree.
-we have to use that key in provider.tf file under api_key section but we directly not user key as it is
-we have to create variable then we can use.
-make changes under configuration option (provider.tf file)

  api_key= var.api_key

-create terraform.tfvars file and add below
 api_key= "INX1p_3sfDGlGjkaFTuV-C9eVjk0t_z8PJPl9N0kDgrUAoHt6IELTUUZUEauDNZx"
Paste your terminal key inside ""

-Now call this variable in side variable block 
-create variable.tf file 
write code
variable "api_key" {
   type = string
}

-save each file ctrl S

-On terminal run terraform init command

-Open spotify in your tab with your account created
-There you will see no playlist available.
-To create playlist go to vs code and crate playlist.tf file and add below codes.

   resource "spotify_playlist" "My song list" {
      name = "My song list"
      tracks = ["Track id"] 
}
-Save file
(My song list is a name of playlist which one you want to create)
(search in any song name in spotify and open that in the URL section you will get track id after/track copy that and paste above code)
(for example ["5fq7CGNYZKJm38HbLwMg9h"] this is id of ek din aap song )

-Now run terraform plan
-You will see all details in terminal

-Now run terraform apply
-Enter value -Yes

-If you refresh spotify you will see playlist added and song added.

-Finish
